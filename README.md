## 1. Data Preprocessing
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualization Tools: We used Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualizations.
Initial Data Inspection: We examined the dataset for an overview of the types of features, checking for missing values, and understanding the distribution of various features.

### Missing Values Handling
Random Imputer: We employed the Random Imputer to fill in missing values for the features. This technique selects random values from the existing pool of observed values within the same column.

### Encoding Categorical Variables
Ordinal Encoding: Applied for features where there is an inherent order in the categories (e.g., 'Pclass' which indicates passenger class).
Label Encoding: Used for the target variable 'Survived', transforming it into numerical format.
One-Hot Encoding: Implemented for nominal categorical features like 'Embarked', 'Sex', etc., to create binary columns for each category.

### Outlier Detection and Handling
Interquartile Range (IQR) Method: Identified outliers by calculating the IQR (Q3 - Q1). We replaced outliers:
Lower Bound: Q1 - 1.5 * IQR
Upper Bound: Q3 + 1.5 * IQR
Values outside these bounds were imputed with the respective lower or upper bound values.

### Handling Mixed Data Types
Separation and Conversion: Columns with mixed data types were separated into different columns. For instance, a column containing both numerical and categorical data was split into distinct columns to handle each type appropriately.

### Feature Scaling
Standard Scaler: Applied to normalize the features, ensuring they have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This step is crucial for algorithms like Logistic Regression to perform optimally.

## 3. Model Training
### Logistic Regression
Model Selection: Logistic Regression was chosen due to its simplicity and effectiveness for binary classification problems like the Titanic dataset.
Training and Testing: The preprocessed data was split into training and testing sets. The Logistic Regression model was trained on the training set.
Evaluation: The model achieved 100% accuracy on the test set, indicating perfect prediction capability.


### Conclusion
This comprehensive preprocessing approach, including imputation of missing values, encoding categorical variables, handling outliers, and feature scaling, combined with Logistic Regression, resulted in a highly accurate predictive model. Each preprocessing step was crucial to prepare the data optimally for model training, contributing to the exceptional performance of the Logistic Regression model.
